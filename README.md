# implementaion details
- Implemented delete, Edit and Like functionality
- Created a header for Router Navigation.
- Implemented a Dark and Light Mode switch.
- Came across 'antd' library at the last stage of development. Implemented the Modal, form validation and a Loading spinner using it for now.
- Icons using Font awesome.
- Used react-bootstrap for the user Cards.
- Tried several Form validation libraries before settling for antd which seemed to be the simplest.
- Used my own css for creating the grid design. Also used inline css at some places.
- Liked users get the users list from redux state itself. Currently just displaying the name but can be scaled to make cards later.
